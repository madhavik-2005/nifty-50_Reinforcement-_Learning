The NSE has filed a case in the Bombay High Court seeking interim relief on the Nifty-based products that SGX said it will start trading from June. SGX revealed NSE’s legal move in a statement it issued on Tuesday. In February, NSE chose to withdraw itself from a decade-old agreement it had with SGX allowing the trading of Nifty index futures in Singapore. Two months later, on April 11, SGX announced a new product that works just like the Nifty index, bypassing Indian exchanges. SGX’s new products are called India futures and India options, and the exchange will use the closing Nifty price to settle new contracts. An NSE spokesperson declined to comment on the issue or share details of the petition. “We have full confidence in our legal position and will vigorously defend this action.

Recently, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the SGX inked a deal to jointly start trading in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City. Although the details of the deal structure have not been divulged, the exchanges will set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV). This SPV will act as a conduit for trading on GIFT for funds based out of Singapore. But does this arrangement really fulfil the purpose of setting up GIFT? Tax havens like Singapore and Dubai have cornered a pie of India’s financial markets. It is no secret that foreign money influences the Indian market from Singapore, and India has no jurisdiction over it. The Narendra Modi government had set up the GIFT City as an alternative to off-shore platforms. Today, GIFT enjoys a blanket 10-year tax holiday and a relaxed regulatory system. The NSE and SGX have signed a deal called GIFT Connect.

The Sensex hit 46,164.10, while the Nifty touched 13,548.90 for the first time in intraday trade. The Sensex closed at 46,103.50, up 495 points, or 1.09 percent, and the Nifty settled 136 points, or 1.02 percent, up at 13,529.10. Global cues were positive as Pfizer started to roll out its coronavirus vaccine in the UK and as investors tracked the ongoing efforts in the US on additional fiscal stimulus.

According to a report, the NSE is considering an evening trading session from 6 pm to 9 pm where market participants can trade futures and options contracts after regular trading hours of 9:15 am to 3:30 pm. The report also suggests that the NSE may extend this session further up to 11:30 pm, as per an anonymous source cited in the report. With longer trading hours, the NSE is aimed at offering Indian traders the opportunity to display faster reactions to global events. Longer sessions are also anticipated to enhance the exchanges’ trading volumes given the widespread concerns over large traders, including proprietary desks and hedge funds, shifting to rivals, such as GIFT City, where trading takes place round the clock. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Sriram Krishnan, Chief Business Development Officer at NSE said, ""There is a bit of hesita"," The National Stock Exchange (NSE) is on its way to introduce extended trading hours for equity derivatives . According to a report, the NSE is considering an evening trading session from 6 pm to 9 pm .

MUMBAI : Retail investors who entered the market in the past two months through September will be worst affected if the broader market indices pull back further from current levels amid surging bond yields in the US and the Israel-Hamas war in West Asia. According to National Stock Exchange (NSE) data, retail investors who directly buy and sell shares on its secondary market made net purchases for a second straight month in September, amounting to ₹7,500 crore. These purchases came on top of the ₹14,400 crore they invested in the previous month, resulting in a cumulative investment of ₹21,900 crore over these two months. This came after net sales of ₹21,400 crore from April to July. Market experts warned that those entering the rally at the peak, driven by a fear of missing out (FOMO) and seeking quick gains, will likely bear the brunt of a deeper cut in case of a more substantial market downturn. “If you"," Retail investors who entered the market in the past two months through September will be worst affected if the broader market indices pull back further from current levels .
